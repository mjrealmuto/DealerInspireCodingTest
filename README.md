Repo for Dealer Inspire Coding Challenge

In the root directory there is a file called: db_create.sql.  This is the file to set up in mysql to create the database and tables for this exercise.  After running, if testing, open public/inc/dbConnect.php and enter in user name and password information so that the form can be saved to the databse. 

Thanks!
